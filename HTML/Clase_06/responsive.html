                <h2>First</h2>
                <p>Where could they be? Close the blast doors! Open the blast doors!
                Open the blast doors! I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again,
                    at last. The circle is now complete. </p>
                <p>When I left you, I was but the learner,
                now I am the master. Only a master of evil, Darth. Your powers are weak,
                old man. You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more
                powerful than you can possibly imagine.</p>

                <h2>Second</h2>
                <p>Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master
            Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi
            jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate
            he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. </p>
                <p>What's wrong with him
            now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the
            southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are
            two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all
            right. I can see one of them now.</p>

                <h2>Third</h2>
                <p>Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like
                    you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in
                    your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio!</p>
                <p>Yes sir? We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...
                    What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your
                    presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other
                    information on your level is restricted.</p>
